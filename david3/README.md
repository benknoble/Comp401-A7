# Comp401-A7

[![This project is archived](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-archived-critical.svg)](https://benknoble.github.io/status/archived/)

This repo will hold tests for A7 for KMP's Fall 2016 Comp 401 class.

### Usage

Download the .java files and add them to a7 in Eclipse to use them

### Contributing

This will be the standard for contributing JUnit tests for all remaining assignments. In order to add new tests, store the .java files in a directory named after your Onyen. Fork this repository, add your new folder, and submit a pull request.

Please note, I can be a stickler for code cleanliness and code readability. If I don't understand your tests, or if I find that Eclipse gives me red/yellow static analysis warnings, I will likely reject the pull requests until those issues are addressed. Keep it clean.

On a further note, if you notice an error in a test: create an issue _first_. By creating the issue, you can signal to other users watching the repo that there is a problem; perhaps someone else can work on it and submit a pull request if you don't have time. However, if you have a fix, go ahead and submit the pull request once you have the issue written. The pull request can close the issue.
